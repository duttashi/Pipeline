### General information

**Summary**

Organizations big or small are gearing up to develop `data pipelines` that serve to collect data (from varied sources), ingest and store data. In this project, I'll be developing such pipelines that are scaleable in nature. 

Some initial idea's to work upon;

- Implement pipeline between `SQL Server`, `R` and/or `Python`.
- Pipeline to scrape data from the web, clean it and save to database.   


The repository contain folders, `data`, `fig`, `man`,`src`.
